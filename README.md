# INTRO-SPRING-BOOT
I'm doing here the basics of what we can do with spring, a sort of introduction to it.

# TOOLS
For my first spring application ,i used :
 1.SPRING BOOT, -> https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
 2.JDBC for persistence and 
 3.POSTGRESQL for the database implementation.

# TO START 
You have to implement the database, 
at the file INTRO-SPRING-BOOT/Introduction_Spring_Boot-STD22105/src
/main/dtTable/allTable , you need to copypaste the script SQL to create all tables, 
and at /mockData you have to copypaste these mock data to complete all  tables.

# OTHER INFO
I used MAVEN for the project management , and LOMBOK for the method getter, setter ,toString and equalsAndHashCode.
I used Java 17 and worked on jMerise for the database mcd.
