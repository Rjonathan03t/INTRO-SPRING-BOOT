# INTRO-SPRING-BOOT
I'm doing here the basics of what we can do with spring, a sort of introduction to it.

# TOOLS
For my first spring application ,i used :
 1.SPRING BOOT,
 2.JDBC for persistence and
 3.POSTGRESQL for the database implementation.

# OTHER INFO
I used MAVEN for the project management , and LOMBOK for the method getter, setter ,toString and equalsAndHashCode.
I used Java 17 and worked on jMerise for the database mcd.
